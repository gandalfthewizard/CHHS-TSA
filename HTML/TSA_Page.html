						<h2 style="text-align:center"> We are TSA</h2>
							<p style="text-align:center"> The Chapel Hill High School Tsa chapter are a group of high schoolers who participate 
							in a TSA chapter. Most of the member had already participated in TSA through another high school, or more commonly, 
							Middle school. Their adviser is MR. Grigg, a shop teacher at Mcdougle Middle school. He pushes for all of the members
							to excel and preform to the best of their abilities whilst in school and participating is TSA events. Each year, he brings both
							the Chapel Hill and Mcdougle students to nationals to preform to the best of their abilities. In Middle school, TSA is publicly announced via the
							Class that Mr. grigg teaches any any students that wish to participate in TSA are welcome to come to a meeting in which the parents are informed
							of the responsibilities and glory of being in TSA. Chapel Hill High's TSA group are not a public club, for in fear of those only interested in another
							fancy title on their application to college and also to stop those who would not be enirely commited to doing TSA. BEcause of this 95% of Chapel Hill High school 
							TSA members attended Mcdougle's TSA group. Here at the Chapel High High School TSA we are only interested in those who may show responsibility and alagiance
							to the TSA chapter. </p>
